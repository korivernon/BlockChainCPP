# BlockChainCPP
## Why?
I've always been fascinated in BlockChain Technology and have always wondered how I can get started in producing and being an active part of the technology's advancement. Here, I've implemented a Blockchain in C++ using Object Oriented Programming in C++.

## Improvements?
There are several improvements that I would like to make to this project: 
- First, adding a graphical user interface
- Having it become a distributed ledger
